# Automate tasks
{{id: uc.automate, parent: uc}}

Basically, Marko assembles artifacts from markup sources, but there are cases when user wants to add some information from other sources like UI/UML/ER design tools, some prepared data files in whatever it could be form. Sometimes the user wants to modify or remove some content inside the markup sources.

Such tasks could be automated by intervening into the artifact tree between assemblage and compilation stages.

__Main Flow__

1. The user design one or more automation scripts
2. The user injects the automation scripts into compilation process
