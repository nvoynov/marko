I want to write my artifacts in a set of separated sources, where each source can represent some logical part of the whole artifact. That way I can focus on a certain task and avoid interfering of other authors who work with me at the same artifact but for different focuses.

@@todo but to assemble the artifact from set of separated sources, one need to have some text linking mechanism, sort of "parent -> child" relationship, and some "sort order" for children

##

I want to use any text editor of my choice for writing artifacts and I certainly don't want to install some new bulky complex new software.

##

I want to build the artifact to present it for the interested parties, in any convenient for the parties format.

I also want to have the ability to customize the output template, and maybe to have a few templates for different audience.

##

When I'm working with sources text, I'd like to have some text macros like "toc", "list", or "todo", so I can be more efficient.

Maybe I could get some part of the artifact and derive some other subdued artifacts? Suppose I have bulky requirements specification and I need to get some sort of estimation sheet.

##

I want to have the history of changes for sources
