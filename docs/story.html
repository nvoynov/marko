<p><a href="https://github.com/nvoynov/marko">Marko</a> is the result of
my ten-year journey with Ruby playing the Business Analyst role.</p>
<h2 id="childhood-2012">Childhood, 2012</h2>
<p>Somewhere in between 2011 and 2014 I was playing Software Engineer
role in some BigKnownCo where my first and foremost working tool was
Microsoft Word 2007. Requirements specifications and Architecture design
documents Artifacts that I was mainly working on often consisted of one
and more hundreds of pages and it was such a pain to deal with in MS
Word which was the corporate standard.</p>
<p>In simple words it just gone crazy on large documents, the program
consumed all my RAM, document navigation was slow, the program simply
stopped responding, which entailed restarting the process with a loss of
changes; or even worse, the loss of style formatting that is invisible
to the eye when you simply cannot see it that the formatting was lost
somewhere on the 225th page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So problem was clear “<strong>The problem of</strong> the lack of
simple reliable tools and approaches for writing software artifacts
<strong>affects</strong> technical writers who develop and manage the
artifacts <strong>the impact of which is</strong> they tend to
choose..”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I come up with the idea to create something light, simple and
reliable to eliminate the MS Word from my work experience once and for
all. This time I was curious about using YAML for storing requirements
just inside file system. And I regularly done some estimations and
prioritization for requirements, so I decided that FPA, PERT, and
Risk-Value prioritization will be valuable features here.</p>
<p>It was my first serious diving into Ruby for few weeks. I succeeded
in reading / writing YAML and even provided estimations algorithms. I
fall in love with Ruby. But from user perspective (I was the user) it
was complete failure. Writing YAML manually was just unforgivable but
that time I was obsessed with the format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>YAML was chosen just because this days I dramatically reduced time
for load configuration of my target service provisioning system, that
stored its configuration tree in RDBMS that causes ~5 000 000 selects
for reading and about the same number insert/update for writing. It just
reduced to 20 000 instead of 5 000 000.</p>

<h2 id="adolescence-2014---2015">Adolescence, 2014 - 2015</h2>
<p>It took two years to return to the subject, I left that job in 2014
and got haft year off. This time I discovered Markdown and static site
generators, and I decided on Markdown as my primary markup format, where
each source is just a plain markdown file with some metadata
excerpt.</p>
<p>Things were going well and in a few months, I got something quite
usable. Estimations algorithms were thrown out; markup sources were
assembled in one artifact that was translated into HTML by Kramdown. I
named it “Creq” for “console requirements” and since then I assembled
all software artifacts in my own tool.</p>
<h2 id="youth-since-2015">Youth, since 2015</h2>
<p>Using my tool daily on a regular basis I discovered Pandoc and then
can translate my artifact into any supported format; provided more
advanced artifact templates, and provided a few templates for different
purposes (draft, customer deliverable, etc.), added macros for tree node
body.</p>
<p>This time I named my tool Clerq because it just was my regular tool -
I started my day from <code>$ git checkout -b new_feature</code> and
finished with merging the branch, assembling new requirements increment,
and pushing into git for my development team.</p>
<p>In 2018 I have read The Clean Architecture I took my first clumsy
attempts to apply it for Clerq.</p>
<h2 id="marko-2022">Marko, 2022</h2>
<p>The last time I used Clerq for two months in July 2022. I noticed
that time that I use only “create a new project” and “build the
artifact” commands. And I realized that there is nothing about
requirements - just about artifact assembling.</p>
<p>So I took two weeks and finished 2022 with a git commit on Dec 31,
2022 :)</p>
<p>The Marko purpose is assembling markup artifact from separated markup
sources. Its interfaces are simple and clear. It could be naturally
extended through Rakefile for any specific purpose related to visiting
artifacts tree nodes.</p>
<p>This is the first time I feel for a product that there are nothing I
want to take or change. Just “Right Product, Done Right, Managed
Messy”</p>
